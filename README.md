Interactive "Learn to read" application for grades K - 12 using the Fry word lists (education).

Interactive?  Yes.  Two people utilize the app at the same time.  One literate person guides, teaches, and interacts with the learner while they utilize the app.

The free sight words here come from Fry's List of 1000 Instant words. His list is made up of the most frequently used words in children's books, novels, articles and textbooks. The words are ranked in order of frequency.

The list was compiled by Dr. Edward B. Fry in 1996.  His research found that just 25 words make up approximately 1/3 of all published text. He noted that 100 words make up about 1/2, and 300 words make up 65% of all written material.

No ads.  No social.  No internet required.  Battery friendly.
